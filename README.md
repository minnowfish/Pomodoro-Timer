## Description
A simple pomoodoro timer project with new features to be added over time.

## What's Next
I will be adding my own customnisation from the tutorial. 
Current focus is:
- [x] Bug fixing for break button
- [ ] Adding notifications


My final goal is to convert this timer into a pester timer. It will pester you when the duration of the break timer is over and you have not started a new focus timer
