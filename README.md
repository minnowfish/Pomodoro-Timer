# Pomodoro-Timer

# Description
A pomoodoro timer project made following [Codedex's Pomodoro Timer Tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js).

# What's Next
I will be adding my own customnisation from the tutorial. 
Current focus is:
- [x] Pause Timer
- [ ] Reset Timer
- [ ] Customnise time.

My final goal is to convert this into something similar to a study room with more customnisation. Hopefully I will be able to implement a backend and deploy the site.
