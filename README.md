# Pomodoro-Timer

# Description
A pomoodoro timer project made following [Codedex's Pomodoro Timer Tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js).

# What's Next
I will be adding my own customnisation from the tutorial. 
Current focus is:
- [x] Pause Timer
- [x] Reset Timer
- [ ] Break Timer

My final goal is to convert this timer into a pester timer! It will basically pester you when the duration of the break timer is over and you have not started a new focus timer
